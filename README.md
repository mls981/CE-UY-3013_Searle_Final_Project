# Mass Balance Equations in Environmental Engineering

## Description
This program will do two things: either help compare reactor types with varying volumes, or tell you how long a reactor must go for in order to achieve a contamination removal goal. The three types of ideal reactor modelss are batch reactors, completely-mixed flow reactors (CMFR), and plug flow reactors (PFR). Since batch reactors have no flow, theta (hydraulic residence time), is replaced with simply a value of time where the contaminated water will exit the reactor. At the end of case 1, percent removal will be displayed for different trials i.e. different reactors with different volumes. Whichever reactor has the highest percent removal is the better option. At the end of case 2, the thetas and time values will be displayed, depending on reactor type. If percent removal goals are the same, the reactor with the shortest time or theta is the most efficient since it is the fastest.
