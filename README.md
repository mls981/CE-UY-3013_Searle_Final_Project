Mass Balance Equations in Environmental Engineering

Introduction: The first task in this program program will determine the flowrate of pure water that needs to be added to a system so that the amount of a contaminant within the final effluent is within a given limit. These contaminants come from the EPA's NSDWR (National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations). These standards are not enforceable by law but strongly encouraged to be adapted by states. Odor, color, and pH were discarded from the NSDWR list since they are not measured the same way as the other contaminants.

The second task determines the hydraulic detention time, flushing time, and volume needed to flush out a contaminant until only a certain concentration remains.

Assumptions: Task 1: Flow is steady in each scenario and the density of water remains constant. We also assume the body of water is well mixed.

Task 2: Unsteady flow and a non reactive contaminant (also known as a tracer). Flowrate at inlet and outlet are the same. Completely Mixed Reactor (CMR).

How To Use: 
Follow input prompts for Task 1. For Task 2, manually change the values of the input variables to meet your needs.

Note to Professor Machairas: I added a second task to add to the practicality of the program.
