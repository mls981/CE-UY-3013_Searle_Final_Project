# Mass Balance Equations in Environmental Engineering

## Description
This program will do two things: either help compare reactor types with varying volumes, or tell you how long a reactor must go for in order to achieve a contamination removal goal. The three types of ideal reactors are batch reactors, completely-mixed flow reactors (CMFR), and plug flow reactors (PFR). Since batch reactors have no flow,
